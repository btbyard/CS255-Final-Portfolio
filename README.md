# CS255-Final-Portfolio
Module 8 portfolio submission for Systems Analysis and Design

In this proejct I worked for a small consulting company that designs systems for various clients. The project lead had assigned me to a new client, DriverPass. 
DriverPass noticed that there are very few tools that train students to pass their driving tests. Their research has found that more than 65% of the
students applying for the driving license exam fail since all they did was study previous tests! DriverPass wanted to provide students with access to
online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. DriverPass wants your help in designing a system that can handle 
these needs. The system has several stakeholders including IT, management, and customers.

I was given an interview transcript from the DriverPass company, that told me an interview with the client and what they wanted from the system. 

I took that information and laid out a system design using several differnt UML type diagrams, that showed all users of the systems, what actions those 
users may take, and how those actions may relate to one another, and each other user. I thought I did really well on my DriverPass use case diagram.

If I could choose one thing to revise, I may edit more differences between and "admin" and "IT" and "teacher" and distinguish the differences a little 
better. 

In approaching this design, I used my current knowledge of common systems in todays world, the info and needs from the customer, and many different UML didagrams to show 
differnt ways to model the system in a modern user friendly way. 

In the future I may jot more notes during the interview, and also Jot notes and things down as a base before I start to layout a diagram.
